# Test Json Data

You can use this repo, along with my VRtualisPublicInfo repo for testing Json server, or making sure that you know how to render dynamic json data.

This is also going to be mainly used by me to make sure that the frameworks I use, I can use them to render dynamic content from servers using json apis.
